This exercise was nice and felt pretty rewarding.  

This past summer, a brewery with an in-house bar recently opened across the street from my house.  
Although I'm not particularly interested in the place, someone else might be, which is why I felt it was an adequate addition to the map, on my part.  

Another reason for adding it was because I find landmarks useful when navigating in an area I'm not familiar with. When I was younger, and even now, I used to like getting lost in different neighborhoods but a problem I often had was finding my way back home - back when I didn't have a phone or even when I did but could only call or text.  
I understand not everyone has a phone and an unlimited plan but it's far more popular now. Plus you can always help out strangers that seem lost!  

Overall, the experience was pretty smooth. I looked up quite a few tags through [OSMâ€™s extremely helpful wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) to make sure I was using them correctly.  
An example of this would be [OSM's map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Building) and differentiating the usages of [building](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) and [land usage](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:landuse).
Another example would be how I had to decide on how to label the building, since it was both industrial and commercial. I chose to label it as retail since they are gaining a lot of profit through their bar and by-the-can purchases.
